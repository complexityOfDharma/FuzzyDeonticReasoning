# FuzzyDR: Agent-based Institutional Modeling with Fuzzy Deontic Reasoning
## Exploring Institutional Compliance with COVID Containment Strategies through Nonpharmaceutical Interventions
@author Brant Horio (2023), George Mason University

FuzzyDR is an agent-based model of institutions with a novel application of fuzzy logic for modeling individual deontic reasoning. A geospatial contagion model for COVID is presented with heterogeneous patterns of life between households, schools, workplaces, and gathering locations. This model provides the basis for computationally exploring the modeling of individual compliance with institutions of nonpharmaceutical intervention containment strategies (e.g., mask wearing, staying at home).
